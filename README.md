# true-hit-sim
Have you ever wanted to prove to the world that the Swordmaster is not as great a class as everyone else claims? Show them that Heroes are better in every way except critical animations? Have you ever wanted to prove why growths and bases go hand in hand for tier making? Well now you can! 

Introducing the **True Hit Sim** (*Name not Final*). This tool can solve those problems for you and with copious amount of data to boot. Now instead of ***lying through your teeth***, quantifiable data is within your power. And relatively easy to gather.

## Features
### Leveling
+ After inputting a unit's stats and growths you can simulate level ups.
+ Great for comparing two units but you need them at equal level.
### Combat
+ After setting up a unit and their foe(s) you can see a battle forecast.
+ Continuing will simulate the combat to get data on projected vs actual hit/crit rates. 

## How to Use
### Standard Users
Follow the command line instructions to decide what you want to do with the program.
Whether it be leveling or battling the system should be pretty straightforward.

### Developers
In the source code you can import the arena/classes/characters/weapons header and cpp files and write your own main file.
You would have add/rewrite the functions found in main but the brunt of the code is in the afformentioned files.

## Plan Log
